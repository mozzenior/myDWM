.SH NAME
dwm \- dynamic window manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dwm
.RB [ \-v ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
dwm is a dynamic window manager for X. It manages windows in tiled, mirror-titled, monocle and floating layouts. Either layout can be applied dynamically, optimising the environment for the application in use and the task performed.
.P
In tiled layouts, windows are managed in a master and stacking area. The master area contains the windows which currently need most attention, whereas the stacking area contains all other windows. In monocle layout all windows are maximised to the screen size. In floating layout windows can be resized and moved freely. Dialog windows are always managed floating, regardless of the layout applied.
.P
Windows are grouped by views. Each view has its own layout method.
.P
Each screen contains a small status bar which displays all available views, the layout of current view, the title of the focused window, and the text read from the root window name property, if the screen is focused. A floating window is indicated with an empty square and a maximised floating window is indicated with a filled square before the windows title. The selected view is indicated with a different color. The view of the focused window is indicated with a filled square in the top left corner. The view which is applied to one or more windows are indicated with an empty square in the top left corner.
.P
dwm draws a small border around windows to indicate the focus state.

.SH BUGS
Java applications which use the XToolkit/XAWT backend may draw grey windows only. The XToolkit/XAWT backend breaks ICCCM-compliance in recent JDK 1.5 and early JDK 1.6 versions, because it assumes a reparenting window manager. Possible workarounds are using JDK 1.4 (which doesn't contain the XToolkit/XAWT backend) or setting the environment variable
.BR AWT_TOOLKIT=MToolkit
(to use the older Motif backend instead) or running
.B xprop -root -f _NET_WM_NAME 32a -set _NET_WM_NAME LG3D
or
.B wmname LG3D
(to pretend that a non-reparenting window manager is running that the XToolkit/XAWT backend can recognize) or when using OpenJDK setting the environment variable
.BR _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1 .
.P
GTK 2.10.9+ versions contain a broken
.BR Save\-As
file dialog implementation, which requests to reconfigure its window size in an endless loop. However, its window is still respondable during this state, so you can simply ignore the flicker until a new GTK version appears, which will fix this bug, approximately GTK 2.10.12+ versions.
